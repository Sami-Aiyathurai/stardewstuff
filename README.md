I had the idea of learning a react and a react-based tech stack by creating web applications about my favorite video game, Stardew Valley.

So this repo holds my projects. 
  1.   The first project is currently called stardew-marriagables. It is my first introduction to react so I started with the simple idea of making a site that displays important information about the stardew marriage candidates(including krobus). However as I want to explore more complex react ideas like hooks so its current plan is a Guess Who mix with hangman to guess the stardew villagers based on identifying info. At the moment, it is a working MVP but there are a couple of the things I need to work on. 1) change hangman to a stardew specific style 2) change keyboard so the entire card is the button rather than having a button on the bottom. 3) change the hints so the lives hint and ULexception hints are both the 5th hint, where if the npc has a UL exception that is the hint. otherwise the 5th hint is the lives hint. 4) change the the hint system so the reading in of data and fitting that with the hard coded rest of hint is more intuitive
