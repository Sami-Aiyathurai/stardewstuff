I had the idea of learning a react and a react-based tech stack by creating web applications about my favorite video game, Stardew Valley.

So this repo holds my projects. 
  1.   The first project is currently called stardew-marriagables. It is my first introduction to react so I started with the simple idea of making a site that displays important information about the stardew marriage candidates(including krobus). However as I want to explore more complex react ideas like hooks so its current plan is a Guess Who mix with hangman to guess the stardew villagers based on identifying info.
