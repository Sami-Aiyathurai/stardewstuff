            <p>
                This is app is for the purpose for track the frequency that the marriagable NPCs in Stardew Valley are actually married. 
                I am counting Krobus as a marriagable along with all of the bachelors and bachelorettes as platonic marriages are just as valid. 
                I have included important friendship information for each npc like non-universal loves and exceptions to the universal loves and like. 
                I also included the movies and treats the npcs love. 
                Please increase the counter for each marriageable that you have actually invited to the farm.
                Happy Romancing!
